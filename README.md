## Description

- The system will be placed on the PCs of retailers across the company and users will be able to use it through their respective web browser applications. It allows users to shop efficiently and find their favourite clothes and own their location. Due to the minimum requirements in the three areas: admin, store owner and user, the project is accessible. Users only need a smartphone, and this application is free for users, they are more likely to use it. The disclosed technology generally relates to image detection and relates to a method and system for drawing an input image with the provided image by applying a trained CNN at the input, especially.

## Graphics
- Output of the Project shows the locaton of the shop which has the desire product.

- This upper image shows that when I uploaded t-shirt image in to the dashboard, during that time I got the feasible location of the shop which containt same product.

- Second one shows that when I uploaded girl image during that time nothing is matched by the network, so it did not show any result at suggestion page.

## Usage
- After installing all the dependencies, I used Pycharm GUI to run the project.  
- This project is the web application so it will run in any operating system. when any user login into this project, they will get one feature and that is upload image.
- Here user can upload their desire product image, according to that product the given network predict the nearer shop location which has this stuff.
- At the end, user can purchase this product by reaching that location.

## Support

- If you find any changes in the code, feel free to contact me. I would love to know the upgradation.

Contact: [email me](mailto:vpatel62@lakeheadu.ca)

## Road-map
- It can be further expanded to not only the local retail shops but also the  mega malls so that people can find their desired product within no time  and at all locations. We hope our work will propose further research in this area.
- We can user other algorithm to achieve more accuracy of the model.


## Acknowledgements
We wish to warmly thank our guide, Professor Dr. T. Tomesh for all their diligence, guidance, encouragement and help throughout the period of project, which have enabled us to complete the project work in time. Their constant inspiration and encouragement along with their valuable guidance has been instrumental in the successful completion of this project. Professor has always been willingly present whenever we needed the slightest support from them. We also thank them for the time that they spared for us, from their extreme busy schedule. We would also like to show our gratitude to our guide for sharing their pearls of wisdom with us during the course of this project. We would like to thank our guide, for their valuable and constructive suggestions during the planning and development of this project work.

## Project Status

- If I talked about the current situation, then model is trained with the small amount of dataset. For improving the accuracy, in future, I will extend the dataset so I will get more accurate result. 

- In future I would like to add more features and if any other person have the similar kind of idea but with the improvment, I would contact him/her and make my project more efficient.
